// 1/30/2017 DEQUE && 2STACKQUEUE
// Deque: Having combined the designs of the Stack and Queue classes, why not combine their features as well. Create a class called Deque (pronounced ‘deck’) that represents a double-ended queue. In addition to the basic six methods, add versions that push and pop from the opposite ends. Specifically, create a class deque, containing methods pushFront(val), pushBack(val), popFront(), popBack(), front(), back(), contains(val), isEmpty(), and size().
// 2StackQueue: Using only two Stack objects for the underlying data storage, recreate a Queue class.
