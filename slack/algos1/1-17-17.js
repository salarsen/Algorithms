// 1/17/2017 ISALPHABETICAL? && BOOK INDEX
// isAlphabetical?(): Nikki, a queen of gentle sarcasm, loves the word facetiously. Lance helpfully points out that it is the only known English word that contains all five vowels in alphabetical order, and it even has a ‘y’ on the end! Nikki takes a break from debugging to turn and give him an acid stare that could only be described as arsenious. Given a string, return whether all letters contained in that string are in alphabetical order.
// Book index: Martin is writing his opus: a book of algorithm challenges, set as lyrics to a suite of baroque fugues. He knows that some of those fugueing challenges will be less popular than others, so he needs a book index. Given a sorted array of pages, produce a book index string. Consecutive pages should form ranges separated by a dash. For [1,3,4,5,7,8,10], return the string "1, 3-5, 7-8, 10".
