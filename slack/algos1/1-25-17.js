// 1/25/2017 PARTITION, DEDUPE, && FILTER/MAP/REDUCE
// Partition: Implement a Class method that partitions a linked list on either it's first value or one passed as a paramater, hereafter called a pivot. Partitioning is the moving of all values less than the pivot to it's 'left', equivalent values adjacent to it, and values greater than it to the 'right'.
// Remove Duplicates: Remove nodes with duplicate values. Following this call, all remaining nodes should have unique values. Retain only first instance of each value.
// Lvl 2: Can you accomplish deduplication without using a secondary buffer? What are the performance ramifications? How long would you expect the function to take to finish, if it was sent an sList of length 5 million?
// Filter/Map/Reduce: Using the documentation for map &/ reduce &/ filter, implement analogous Class method(s) for your Linked List.
