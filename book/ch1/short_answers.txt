What is source code?
- Sequence of instructions that are provided to a computer to execute variety of tasks and computation

What makes computer so "smart", anyways?
- Allows computer to execute calculations at high speeds and iterate through data

What is the purpose of a programming language?
- provide a set of instructions in a language that can be translated from human (pseudo code) to computer (binary)

What are 3 examples of programming languages? why are there so many of these?
- C++, PHP, Python - each has different strengths and weaknesses, can be used for variety of tasks depending on data processing and capabilities needed

What is a variable? Why are variables useful?
- a specific spot in memory with a label for referencing or inspecting the value. Allows us to store data temporarily in memory while calculations are run

What is the difference between a single-equals (=) and a double-equals (==)?
- single sets a variable to a value. double runs a non-strict comparison. It will convert values to same type before comparing

What is the difference between a double-equals (==) and a triple-equals (===)?
- loose comparison (converts values to same type before comparison) or strict-comparison

Why does the developer console exist?
- to debug and test

When we talk about "conditional" statements, what does that mean? What is an example?
- comparison between two values to see if a "condition" is met to execute code

Why would we want FOR or WHILE loops in our source code?
- to iterate through large sums of data quickly

When would you use a WHILE loop, instead of a FOR loop?
- when we do not know amount of data to iterate through or when looking for a specific case

What is a function? Why would we use functions?
- store code that is used repetitively in loops or other functions rather than rewriting it in each place its used

How many values can you receive back from a function? How many values can you send in?
- output: 1 but it can be of style tuple, array, string, etc... can join values together and pass back as one (or object)
- input: infinite

What is an array? How many values does it hold?
- a variable that can store multiple values that can be accessed individually by specifying where in the variable to look, i.e. position 0 or position 1 will return different values in an array of size 2

What is a T-diagram and why should I know how to use one?
- a method of recording all local variables while working through a loop and/or function
- help diagnose a function/loop that works through an array

What are the two ways to comment JS code? When would you use one versue the other?
using double slash // or /* */, single line vs. multiline comments
